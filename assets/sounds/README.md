# Audio Files

This directory contains audio files for the Crystal Grimoire meditation features.

## Structure

- `bowl_*.mp3` - Crystal bowl sounds at various frequencies
- `binaural_*.mp3` - Binaural beats for chakra meditation
- `nature/` - Natural ambient sounds
- `guided/` - Guided meditation audio tracks

## Note

Currently, these files are placeholders. In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Generate or source actual crystal bowl recordings
2. Create binaural beat audio files at the correct frequencies
3. Add nature sound recordings
4. Record or source guided meditation tracks

The app gracefully handles missing audio files by catching exceptions and logging errors.
