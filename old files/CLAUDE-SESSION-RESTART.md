# Claude Session Restart - Quick Context Recovery

## üö® IMMEDIATE STATUS CHECK

**READ THIS FIRST** when starting any session on Crystal Grimoire project.

### Current Project State
- **Location**: `/mnt/c/Users/millz/Desktop/CrystalGrimoireBeta0.2/`
- **Status**: Transitioning from demo to fully functional integrated system
- **User Criticism**: "you kind of just took the old app and made a non working demo"
- **Mandate**: Restore REAL functionality from Alpha, integrate all systems

### What Was Just Completed
‚úÖ Current Beta0.2 work saved as demo
‚úÖ Located original working Alpha code at `/mnt/c/Users/millz/Desktop/CrystalGrimoire-WORKING-BACKUP/`

### CRITICAL IMMEDIATE TASKS
1. **Replace Main Logo**: Find amethyst icon from "Crystal of the Day" widget and replace spinning text logo
2. **Restore Real LLM**: Replace mock responses with actual OpenAI/Claude/Gemini integration
3. **Integrate Systems**: Make every feature reference user's stones, birth chart, and mood data
4. **Restore Pro Features**: Moon Ritual Planner, Crystal Healing, Sound Bath, Journal (from Alpha)

### NEVER DO AGAIN
‚ùå Create simplified/demo versions ("non working demo")
‚ùå Use mock data or placeholder responses
‚ùå Build isolated features that don't integrate
‚ùå Ignore user's personal data (stones, birth chart, journal history)

### Key Integration Points
- **Every LLM prompt** must include user's crystal collection and birth chart
- **Every feature** must reference shared data models
- **Journal mood** should influence next-day recommendations
- **Moon phases** should suggest rituals using owned crystals
- **Healing sessions** should only recommend owned stones

### What To Check Before Starting
1. Read `/mnt/c/Users/millz/Desktop/CrystalGrimoireBeta0.2/CLAUDE-INTEGRATION-CONTEXT.md`
2. Check TodoRead for current task status
3. Verify you're working in the Beta0.2 directory (NOT the demo)
4. Confirm access to original Alpha code at `CrystalGrimoire-WORKING-BACKUP`

### User's Vision
"ALL THE SYSTEMS AND FEATURES CAN BEST WORK IN AN INTEGRATED WAY. THE USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO STORE THEIR STONES AND THE LLM POWERED PROMPTS SHOULD USE THOSE STONES FOR SUGGESTIONS. IT SHOULD ALSO KNOW PAID USERS BIRTH PLACE AND TIME TO INTEGRATE HOROSCOPE INFO FOR THAT STUFF. BUT EVERY BUTTON OR SYSTEM SHOULD CONNECT AND INTERACT WITH THE OTHER ONES THA LOGICALLY MAKE SENSE"

**Bottom Line**: Build a unified metaphysical platform where everything connects, not a collection of separate demo features.
